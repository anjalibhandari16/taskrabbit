Created a React project using Create-react-app.

1. Login/Registration Page : Used state(component state) to manage the login Page.

2. User Home page : User gets 3 options (upload an img, update his profile, update user info) along with the logout button.

3. the upload image page contains the file upload through input tag.

4. User can update the name and bio. This data is stored in component state and can be sent/retrieved through api calling(used axios here)

5. the task management page, contains 1 input tag along with a button to puch data/item to the list maintained by a state array. Used map on it to iterate the data and diaplay it on screen along with the delete key that carry its task_id to delete that value from array.
